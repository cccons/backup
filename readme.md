# Backup

A simple wrapper around rsync

### Installation

Download and copy to your path (or don't) and just run it from wherever.

### Usage

To see usage, you can clone the repo and run the script with `-h` or `--help`.
Or, if you prefer, open up the script and look at the `usage` function.

### Uninstallation

```bash
$ rm /path/to/the/script/backup.sh
```
